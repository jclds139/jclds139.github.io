 abstract = {Crowd monitoring involves tracking and analyzing the behavior of large groups of people in large-scale public spaces, such as sports games. In sports stadiums, understanding audience reactions to the games and their distribution around the public facilities is important for ensuring public safety and security, enhancing the game experience, and improving crowd management. Recent crowd-crushing incidents (e.g., Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster, Seoul Halloween Stampede) have caused 100+ deaths in a single event, calling for advancements in crowd monitoring methods. Existing monitoring approaches include manual observation, wearables, video-, audio-, and WiFi-based sensing. However, few meet the practical needs due to their limitations in cost, privacy protection, and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce GameVibes, a novel method for crowd behavior monitoring using crowd-induced floor vibrations to infer audience reactions to the game (e.g., clapping, stomping, dancing) and crowd traffic (i.e., the number of people entering each door). The main benefits of GameVibes are that it allows continuous, fine-grained crowd monitoring in a cost-effective and non-intrusive way and is perceived as more privacy-friendly. Unlike monitoring an individual person, crowd monitoring involves understanding the overall behavior of a large population (typically more than 1,000), leading to high uncertainty in the vibration data. To overcome the challenge, we first establish the game and facility association to inform the context of crowd behaviors, including 1) game associations (temporal context) between the crowd reaction and the game progress and 2) facility associations (spatial context) between the crowd traffic and facility layouts. Then, we formulate the crowd monitoring problem by converting the conceptual graph of the audience-game-facility association into probabilistic game/facility association models. Through these models, GameVibes first learns the latent representations of the game progress and facility layout through neural network encoders, and then integrates heterogeneous game/facility information and vibration data to estimate crowd behaviors. This mitigates the estimation error due to the uncertainty in vibration data. To evaluate our approach, we conduct 6 real-world deployments for NCAA Pac-12 games at Stanford Maples Pavilion. Our results show that GameVibes achieves a 0.9 F-1 score in crowd reaction monitoring and 9.3 mean absolute error in crowd traffic estimation, which correspond to 10% and 12.2% error reduction, respectively, compared to the baseline methods without context-specific information.},
