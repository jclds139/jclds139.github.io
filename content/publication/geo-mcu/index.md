abstract: Accurate and scalable structural vibration sensing is an essential tool
  for a wide range of applications including human and animal health and safety. We
  present GeoMCU, an open-source, low-noise, sensing platform based around geophones,
  designed for adaptability and resilience in diverse, real-world environments. GeoMCU
  builds on an iterative, experience-driven development process to yield an adaptable
  sensor platform which reduces electrical noise interference, allows flexible sensor
  deployment, and supports high precision and time synchronization where required.
  Evaluation of the platform shows a 4× reduction in electrical noise and over a 10×
  increase in mean time between failures compared to prior solutions. Through multiple
  field deployments---ranging from livestock health monitoring to human heart rate
  detection and stadium crowd behavior analysis---GeoMCU~has demonstrated significant
  advantages in scalability, adaptability, and reliability which present a promising
  solution for ubiquitous sensing in scientific, industrial, and residential environments.
