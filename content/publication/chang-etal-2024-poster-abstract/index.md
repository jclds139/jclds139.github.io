abstract: This paper addresses challenges in monitoring human behavior in crowds through floor vibration sensing, overcoming limitations like subjective manual observation, visual occlusions, and audio interference. Our approach involves tackling limited-data vibration signal tasks by conducting pre-training across modalities, leveraging publicly available audio datasets. By leveraging self-supervised representation learning to pre-train on publicly available audio datasets, our approach reduces data requirements, improves robustness, and minimizes the need for human labeling efforts. Evaluation using in-game stadium vibration data with YouTube audio dataset demonstrates up to 5.8Ã— error reduction for crowd behavior.
