abstract:
    Crowd monitoring involves tracking and analyzing the behavior of large groups
    of people in large-scale public spaces, such as sports games. In sports stadiums,
    understanding audience reactions to the games and their distribution around the
    public facilities is important for ensuring public safety and security, enhancing
    the game experience, and improving crowd management. Recent crowd-crushing incidents
    (e.g., Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster, Seoul Halloween Stampede) have caused 100+ deaths
    in a single event, calling for advancements in crowd monitoring methods. Existing
    monitoring approaches include manual observation, wearables, video-, audio-, and
    WiFi-based sensing. However, few meet the practical needs due to their limitations
    in cost, privacy protection, and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce GameVibes,
    a novel method for crowd behavior monitoring using crowd-induced floor vibrations
    to infer audience reactions to the game (e.g., clapping, stomping, dancing) and
    crowd traffic (i.e., the number of people entering each door). The main benefits
    of GameVibes are that it allows continuous, fine-grained crowd monitoring in a cost-effective
    and non-intrusive way and is perceived as more privacy-friendly. Unlike monitoring
    an individual person, crowd monitoring involves understanding the overall behavior
    of a large population (typically more than 1,000), leading to high uncertainty in
    the vibration data. To overcome the challenge, we first establish the game and facility
    association to inform the context of crowd behaviors, including 1) game associations
    (temporal context) between the crowd reaction and the game progress and 2) facility
    associations (spatial context) between the crowd traffic and facility layouts. Then,
    we formulate the crowd monitoring problem by converting the conceptual graph of
    the audience-game-facility association into probabilistic game/facility association
    models. Through these models, GameVibes first learns the latent representations
    of the game progress and facility layout through neural network encoders, and then
    integrates heterogeneous game/facility information and vibration data to estimate
    crowd behaviors. This mitigates the estimation error due to the uncertainty in vibration
    data. To evaluate our approach, we conduct 6 real-world deployments for NCAA Pac-12
    games at Stanford Maples Pavilion. Our results show that GameVibes achieves a 0.9
    F-1 score in crowd reaction monitoring and 9.3 mean absolute error in crowd traffic
    estimation, which correspond to 10% and 12.2% error reduction, respectively, compared
    to the baseline methods without context-specific information.
