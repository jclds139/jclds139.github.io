abstract: Displays capable of true holographic video have been prohibitively expensive and difficult to build. With this paper, we present a suite of modularized hardware components and software tools needed to build a Holovideo Monitor with basic “hacker-space” equipment, highlighting improvements that have enabled the total materials cost to fall to $820, well below that of other holographic displays. It is our hope that the current level of simplicity, development, design flexibility, and documentation will enable the lay engineer, programmer, and scientist to relatively easily replicate, modify, and build upon our designs, bringing true holographic video to the masses.
