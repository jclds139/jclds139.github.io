abstract:
    Crowd monitoring for sports games is important to improve public safety,
    game experience, and venue management. Recent crowd-crushing incidents (e.g., the
    Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster) have caused 100+ deaths, calling for advancements in
    crowd-monitoring methods. Existing monitoring approaches include manual observation,
    wearables, video-, audio-, and WiFi-based sensing. However, few meet the practical
    needs due to their limitations in cost, privacy protection, and accuracy.In this
    paper, we introduce a novel crowd monitoring method that leverages floor vibrations
    to infer crowd reactions (e.g., clapping) and traffic (i.e., the number of people
    entering) in sports stadiums. Our method allows continuous crowd monitoring in a
    privacy-friendly and cost-effective way. Unlike monitoring one person, crowd monitoring
    involves a large population, leading to high uncertainty in the vibration data.
    To overcome the challenge, we bring in the context of crowd behaviors, including
    (1) temporal context to inform crowd reactions to the highlights of the game and
    (2) spatial context to inform crowd traffic in relation to the facility layouts.
    We deployed our system at Stanford Maples Pavilion and Michigan Stadium for real-world
    evaluation, which shows a 14.7% and 12.5% error reduction compared to the baseline
    methods without the context information.
