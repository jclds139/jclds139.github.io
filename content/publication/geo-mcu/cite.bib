 abstract = {Accurate and scalable structural vibration sensing is an essential tool for a wide range of applications including human and animal health and safety. We present GeoMCU, an open-source, low-noise, sensing platform based around geophones, designed for adaptability and resilience in diverse, real-world environments. GeoMCU builds on an iterative, experience-driven development process to yield an adaptable sensor platform which reduces electrical noise interference, allows flexible sensor deployment, and supports high precision and time synchronization where required. Evaluation of the platform shows a 4× reduction in electrical noise and over a 10× increase in mean time between failures compared to prior solutions. Through multiple field deployments---ranging from livestock health monitoring to human heart rate detection and stadium crowd behavior analysis---GeoMCU~has demonstrated significant advantages in scalability, adaptability, and reliability which present a promising solution for ubiquitous sensing in scientific, industrial, and residential environments.},
