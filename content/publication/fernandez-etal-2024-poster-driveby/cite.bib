 abstract = {Computer vision has been used more ubiquitously in recent years to understand and measure the environment around us, particularly in our neighborhoods. However, many city-wide sensing applications using vision require large labeling efforts, making various applications difficult on a wide scale. We propose a framework for labeling and self-training of in-car video to detect trash on the roads. Our approach requires minimal manual labeling to identify items not meant to be in the street, sidewalk, or public places, from a front-viewing car camera. Our system provides each frame of a video with a score indicating the amount of trash. To prevent overfitting, due to minimal available data, we remove data with high certainty of trash from the training dataset. The results show that our prediction with manually labeled ground truth yield an R2 of 0.66.},
