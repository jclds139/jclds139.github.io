abstract:
    Pig vital sign monitoring (e.g., estimating the heart rate (HR) and respiratory
    rate (RR)) is essential to understand the stress level of the sow and detect the
    onset of parturition. It helps to maximize peri-natal survival and improve animal
    well-being in swine production. The existing approach mainly relies on manual measurement,
    which is labor-intensive and only provides a few points of information. Other sensing
    modalities such as wearables and cameras are developed to enable more continuous
    measurement, but are still limited due to animal discomfort, data transfer, and
    storage challenges. In this paper, we introduce PigV2, the first system to monitor
    pig heart rate and respiratory rate through ground vibrations. Our approach leverages
    the insight that both heartbeat and respiration generate ground vibrations when
    the sow is lying on the floor. We infer vital information by sensing and analyzing
    these vibrations. The main challenge in developing PigV2 is the overlap of vital-
    and non-vital-related information in the vibration signals, including pig movements,
    pig postures, pig-to-sensor distances, and so on. To address this issue, we first
    characterize their effects, extract their current status, and then reduce their
    impact by adaptively interpolating vital rates over multiple sensors. PigV2 is evaluated
    through a real-world deployment with 30 pigs. It has 3.4% and 8.3% average errors
    in monitoring the HR and RR of the sows, respectively.
