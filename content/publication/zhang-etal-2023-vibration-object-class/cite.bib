 abstract = {Object classification is a vital technology that is widely used to track and identify misplaced and out-of-stock items in shopping centers. While there have been a number of studies utilizing various sensing modalities such as computer vision, RFID, and vibration sensors, these methods are limited in their use due to privacy concerns, scalability, and the inability to identify stationary objects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel active vibration-sensing approach for object classification by utilizing music as an excitation source. Different objects can induce different deformations of the surface and further change the surface structural response. Therefore, we leverage vibrations from music on a store shelf and measure the structural responses on the surface when different objects are placed. Our evaluation of a store shelf demonstrates that distinct object characteristics lead to unique vibration responses, enabling accurate classification of 98.6% accuracy in distinguishing five common store objects. This study provides a promising avenue for a reliable, privacy-preserving, and scalable object classification system in various settings beyond shopping centers.},
