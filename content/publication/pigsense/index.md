abstract:
    Precision Swine Farming has the potential to directly benefit swine health
    and industry profit by automatically monitoring the growth and health of pigs. We
    introduce the first system to use structural vibration to track animals, and the
    first system for automated characterization of piglet group activities, including
    nursing, sleeping, and active times. PigSense uses physical knowledge of the structural
    vibration characteristics caused by pig-activity-induced load changes to recognize
    different behaviors of the sow and piglets. In order for our system to survive the
    harsh environment of the farrowing pen for three months, we designed simple, durable
    sensors for physical fault tolerance, then installed many of them, pooling their
    data to achieve algorithmic fault tolerance even when some do stop working. The
    key focus of this work was to create a robust system that can withstand challenging
    environments, has limited installation and maintenance requirements, and uses domain
    knowledge to precisely detect a variety of swine activities in noisy conditions
    while remaining flexible enough to adapt to future activities and applications.
    We provided an extensive analysis and evaluation of all-round swine activities and
    scenarios from our 1-year field deployment across two pig farms in Thailand and
    the USA. To help assess the risk of crushing, farrowing sicknesses, and poor maternal
    behaviors, PigSense achieves an average of 97.8% and 94% for sow posture and motion
    monitoring, respectively, and an average of 96% and 71% for ingestion and excretion
    detection. To help farmers monitor piglet feeding, starvation, and illness, PigSense
    achieves an average of 87.7%, 89.4%, and 81.9% in predicting different levels of
    nursing, sleeping, and being active, respectively. In addition, we show that our
    monitoring of signal energy changes allows the prediction of farrowing in advance,
    as well as status tracking during the farrowing process and on the occasion of farrowing
    issues. Furthermore, PigSense also predicts the daily pattern and weight gain in
    the lactation cycle with 89% accuracy, a metric that can be used to monitor the
    piglets' growth progress over the lactation cycle.
