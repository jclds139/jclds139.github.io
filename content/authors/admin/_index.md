## About Me

Jesse R Codling is a Ph.D. Candidate at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor working with [Dr. Pei Zhang](https://peizhang.engin.umich.edu/). Before moving to the University of Michigan in 2021, he was a Ph.D. Candidate at Carnegie Mellon University. Jesse's research focuses on embedded sensing systems using vibrations to facilitate health and activity monitoring for humans and animals. In particular his work leverages physical environmental information in order to overcome noise and reliability issues inherent when deploying devices in harsh environments.
