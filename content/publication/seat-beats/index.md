abstract:
    Monitoring cardiovascular risk factors requires a method for con-tinuous
    heart rate monitoring. However, this typically relies on a wearable device which
    must be issued to, then charged and worn by the user. Ambient sensors can address
    these challenges, but have only been usable in scenarios where the body is in proximity
    or contact with these sensors, such as on a bed. In this paper, we present SeatBeats,
    a system that can monitor heart rate using ambient vibrations in the surface a user
    sits on. The system relies on the surface's response to heart beat-induced vibrations
    and utilizes autocorrelation to capture and extract the repeated pattern beats.
    Our experiments in a real office environment show up to 96% accuracy relative to
    a smartwatch heart rate sensor.
