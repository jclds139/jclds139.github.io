abstract: Automated monitoring of sow welfare and behaviors is a crucial tool in precision
  swine farming, giving farmers access to continuous streams of sow health information.
  Monitoring the activity of the sows helps farmers detect stress, sickness and signs
  of farrowing, which enables the farmers to provide timely care. Prior work in swine
  monitoring frequently uses video cameras, which have lighting and large storage
  and processing requirements. Alternatively, other work has used wearable sensors,
  which have limited longevity due to durability and battery requirements and suffer
  from scalability challenges due to the need for individual sensors worn by each
  sow. The objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of geophone sensors
  mounted under the floor that measure the structural vibration of a farrowing pen
  to determine posture changes and animal feeding activity. A total of 6 farrowing/lactating
  sows and litters have been used in these studies. The data were collected from a
  minimum of 3 days before farrowing to approximately 25 days post-farrow. Up to five
  geophones were used for activity classification. Machine learning classification
  methods are used to detect the position and feeding activity of the sow and her
  piglets, including tree classifiers and principal component analysis. Accuracies
  of over 95% were achieved in sow posture and feeding activity classification, indicating
  the potential of monitoring  ground vibration as a source of health information.
