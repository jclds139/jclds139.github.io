abstract: "Urban street conditions such as cleanliness and infrastructure decay affect
  public health and community well-being, yet monitoring often relies on subjective
  human judgment. Existing machine learning approaches narrowly target single factors
  like trash detection or road damage and require large datasets or costly pipelines.
  To balance task generalization with limited data, we propose a lightweight, interpretable
  pipeline for holistic condition assessment from street-level imagery. Using 325
  images from seven U.S. cities with ten annotators per image, we find conventional
  models plateau at ~ 57% accuracy, but subjectivity-aware cleaning raises performance
  to ~ 62%, surpassing the weakest human annotator. Our contribution is empirical
  and methodological: we show that explicitly modeling annotator subjectivity can
  yield more reliable gains in handling noisy, subjective datasets than increasing
  algorithmic complexity, positioning lightweight pipelines as practical first-pass
  classifiers for scalable urban monitoring."
