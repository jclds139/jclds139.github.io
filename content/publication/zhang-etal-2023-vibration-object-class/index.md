abstract:
    Object classification is a vital technology that is widely used to track
    and identify misplaced and out-of-stock items in shopping centers. While there have
    been a number of studies utilizing various sensing modalities such as computer vision,
    RFID, and vibration sensors, these methods are limited in their use due to privacy
    concerns, scalability, and the inability to identify stationary objects. To overcome
    these limitations, we propose a novel active vibration-sensing approach for object
    classification by utilizing music as an excitation source. Different objects can
    induce different deformations of the surface and further change the surface structural
    response. Therefore, we leverage vibrations from music on a store shelf and measure
    the structural responses on the surface when different objects are placed. Our evaluation
    of a store shelf demonstrates that distinct object characteristics lead to unique
    vibration responses, enabling accurate classification of 98.6% accuracy in distinguishing
    five common store objects. This study provides a promising avenue for a reliable,
    privacy-preserving, and scalable object classification system in various settings
    beyond shopping centers.
