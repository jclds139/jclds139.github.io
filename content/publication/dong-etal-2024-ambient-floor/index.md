abstract:
    Muscular dystrophies (MD) are a group of genetic neuromuscular disorders
    that cause progressive weakness and loss of muscles over time, influencing 1 in
    3500--5000 children worldwide. New and exciting treatment options have led to a
    critical need for a clinical post-marketing surveillance tool to confirm the efficacy
    and safety of these treatments after individuals receive them in a commercial setting.
    For MDs, functional gait assessment is a common approach to evaluate the efficacy
    of the treatments because muscle weakness is reflected in individuals' walking patterns.
    However, there is little incentive for the family to continue to travel for such
    assessments due to the lack of access to specialty centers. While various existing
    sensing devices, such as cameras, force plates, and wearables can assess gait at
    home, they are limited by privacy concerns, area of coverage, and discomfort in
    carrying devices, which is not practical for long-term, continuous monitoring in
    daily settings. In this study, we introduce a novel functional gait assessment system
    using ambient floor vibrations, which is non-invasive and scalable, requiring only
    low-cost and sparsely deployed geophone sensors attached to the floor surface, suitable
    for in-home usage. Our system captures floor vibrations generated by footsteps from
    patients while they walk around and analyzes such vibrations to extract essential
    gait health information. To enhance interpretability and reliability under various
    sensing scenarios, we translate the signal patterns of floor vibration to pathological
    gait patterns related to MD, and develop a hierarchical learning algorithm that
    aggregates insights from individual footsteps to estimate a person's overall gait
    performance. When evaluated through real-world experiments with 36 subjects (including
    15 patients with MD), our floor vibration sensing system achieves a 94.8% accuracy
    in predicting functional gait stages for patients with MD. Our approach enables
    accurate, accessible, and scalable functional gait assessment, bringing MD progressive
    tracking into real life.
