  abstract = {Automated monitoring of sow welfare and behaviors is a crucial tool in precision swine farming, giving farmers access to continuous streams of sow health information. Monitoring the activity of the sows helps farmers detect stress, sickness and signs of farrowing, which enables the farmers to provide timely care. Prior work in swine monitoring frequently uses video cameras, which have lighting and large storage and processing requirements. Alternatively, other work has used wearable sensors, which have limited longevity due to durability and battery requirements and suffer from scalability challenges due to the need for individual sensors worn by each sow. The objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness of geophone sensors mounted under the floor that measure the structural vibration of a farrowing pen to determine posture changes and animal feeding activity. A total of 6 farrowing/lactating sows and litters have been used in these studies. The data were collected from a minimum of 3 days before farrowing to approximately 25 days post-farrow. Up to five geophones were used for activity classification. Machine learning classification methods are used to detect the position and feeding activity of the sow and her piglets, including tree classifiers and principal component analysis. Accuracies of over 95\% were achieved in sow posture and feeding activity classification, indicating the potential of monitoring  ground vibration as a source of health information.},

  abstract = {Heart rate is one of the most critical metrics for human health. Most common methods for measuring human heart rate involve body contact, whether from wearable devices or manual measurement. However, such devices can cause discomfort to some patients. Past work for non-contact or remote heart rate measurement (e.g., camera or radio) is often limited by line-of-sight requirements that are not always possible in the real-world environment.This paper presents FloHR, an indirect heart rate monitoring system for human beings using heartbeat-induced floor vibrations. The key insight is that the human body generates a small wave of pressure and sound with each heartbeat. These are propagated as vibration through the structures the person is in contact with (e.g., a chair) and through the floor. FloHR then detects and interprets these small floor vibrations. We developed a highly sensitive vibration sensing system and heartbeat pattern modelling to identify these tiny vibrations among other body motions and ambient noise.We evaluated FloHR in a real home environment, demonstrating an average heart rate error similar to medical device standards on the floor near the subjects' chair, and on the order of 10 beats per minute (bpm) on the floor 2 meters away from the subject.},

  abstract = {Muscular dystrophies (MD) are a group of genetic neuromuscular disorders that cause progressive weakness and loss of muscles over time, influencing 1 in 3500--5000 children worldwide. New and exciting treatment options have led to a critical need for a clinical post-marketing surveillance tool to confirm the efficacy and safety of these treatments after individuals receive them in a commercial setting. For MDs, functional gait assessment is a common approach to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments because muscle weakness is reflected in individuals' walking patterns. However, there is little incentive for the family to continue to travel for such assessments due to the lack of access to specialty centers. While various existing sensing devices, such as cameras, force plates, and wearables can assess gait at home, they are limited by privacy concerns, area of coverage, and discomfort in carrying devices, which is not practical for long-term, continuous monitoring in daily settings. In this study, we introduce a novel functional gait assessment system using ambient floor vibrations, which is non-invasive and scalable, requiring only low-cost and sparsely deployed geophone sensors attached to the floor surface, suitable for in-home usage. Our system captures floor vibrations generated by footsteps from patients while they walk around and analyzes such vibrations to extract essential gait health information. To enhance interpretability and reliability under various sensing scenarios, we translate the signal patterns of floor vibration to pathological gait patterns related to MD, and develop a hierarchical learning algorithm that aggregates insights from individual footsteps to estimate a person's overall gait performance. When evaluated through real-world experiments with 36 subjects (including 15 patients with MD), our floor vibration sensing system achieves a 94.8\% accuracy in predicting functional gait stages for patients with MD. Our approach enables accurate, accessible, and scalable functional gait assessment, bringing MD progressive tracking into real life.},

However, few meet the practical needs due to their limitations in cost, privacy protection, and accuracy.In this paper, we introduce a novel crowd monitoring method that leverages floor vibrations to infer crowd reactions (e.g., clapping) and traffic (i.e., the number of people entering) in sports stadiums. Our method allows continuous crowd monitoring in a privacy-friendly and cost-effective way. Unlike monitoring one person, crowd monitoring involves a large population, leading to high uncertainty in the vibration data. To overcome the challenge, we bring in the context of crowd behaviors, including (1) temporal context to inform crowd reactions to the highlights of the game and (2) spatial context to inform crowd traffic in relation to the facility layouts. We deployed our system at Stanford Maples Pavilion and Michigan Stadium for real-world evaluation, which shows a 14.7\% and 12.5\% error reduction compared to the baseline methods without the context information.},

We propose a framework for labeling and self-training of in-car video to detect trash on the roads. Our approach requires minimal manual labeling to identify items not meant to be in the street, sidewalk, or public places, from a front-viewing car camera. Our system provides each frame of a video with a score indicating the amount of trash. To prevent overfitting, due to minimal available data, we remove data with high certainty of trash from the training dataset. The results show that our prediction with manually labeled ground truth yield an R2 of 0.66.},

  abstract = {Crowd monitoring involves tracking and analyzing the behavior of large groups of people in large-scale public spaces, such as sports games. In sports stadiums, understanding audience reactions to the games and their distribution around the public facilities is important for ensuring public safety and security, enhancing the game experience, and improving crowd management. Recent crowd-crushing incidents (e.g., Kanjuruhan Stadium disaster, Seoul Halloween Stampede) have caused 100+ deaths in a single event, calling for advancements in crowd monitoring methods. Existing monitoring approaches include manual observation, wearables, video-, audio-, and WiFi-based sensing. However, few meet the practical needs due to their limitations in cost, privacy protection, and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce GameVibes, a novel method for crowd behavior monitoring using crowd-induced floor vibrations to infer audience reactions to the game (e.g., clapping, stomping, dancing) and crowd traffic (i.e., the number of people entering each door). The main benefits of GameVibes are that it allows continuous, fine-grained crowd monitoring in a cost-effective and non-intrusive way and is perceived as more privacy-friendly. Unlike monitoring an individual person, crowd monitoring involves understanding the overall behavior of a large population (typically more than 1,000), leading to high uncertainty in the vibration data. To overcome the challenge, we first establish the game and facility association to inform the context of crowd behaviors, including 1) game associations (temporal context) between the crowd reaction and the game progress and 2) facility associations (spatial context) between the crowd traffic and facility layouts. Then, we formulate the crowd monitoring problem by converting the conceptual graph of the audience-game-facility association into probabilistic game/facility association models. Through these models, GameVibes first learns the latent representations of the game progress and facility layout through neural network encoders, and then integrates heterogeneous game/facility information and vibration data to estimate crowd behaviors. This mitigates the estimation error due to the uncertainty in vibration data. To evaluate our approach, we conduct 6 real-world deployments for NCAA Pac-12 games at Stanford Maples Pavilion. Our results show that GameVibes achieves a 0.9 F-1 score in crowd reaction monitoring and 9.3 mean absolute error in crowd traffic estimation, which correspond to 10\% and 12.2\% error reduction, respectively, compared to the baseline methods without context-specific information.},

  abstract = {Precision Swine Farming has the potential to directly benefit swine health and industry profit by automatically monitoring the growth and health of pigs. We introduce the first system to use structural vibration to track animals, and the first system for automated characterization of piglet group activities, including nursing, sleeping, and active times. PigSense uses physical knowledge of the structural vibration characteristics caused by pig-activity-induced load changes to recognize different behaviors of the sow and piglets. In order for our system to survive the harsh environment of the farrowing pen for three months, we designed simple, durable sensors for physical fault tolerance, then installed many of them, pooling their data to achieve algorithmic fault tolerance even when some do stop working. The key focus of this work was to create a robust system that can withstand challenging environments, has limited installation and maintenance requirements, and uses domain knowledge to precisely detect a variety of swine activities in noisy conditions while remaining flexible enough to adapt to future activities and applications. We provided an extensive analysis and evaluation of all-round swine activities and scenarios from our 1-year field deployment across two pig farms in Thailand and the USA. To help assess the risk of crushing, farrowing sicknesses, and poor maternal behaviors, PigSense achieves an average of 97.8\% and 94\% for sow posture and motion monitoring, respectively, and an average of 96\% and 71\% for ingestion and excretion detection. To help farmers monitor piglet feeding, starvation, and illness, PigSense achieves an average of 87.7\%, 89.4\%, and 81.9\% in predicting different levels of nursing, sleeping, and being active, respectively. In addition, we show that our monitoring of signal energy changes allows the prediction of farrowing in advance, as well as status tracking during the farrowing process and on the occasion of farrowing issues. Furthermore, PigSense also predicts the daily pattern and weight gain in the lactation cycle with 89\% accuracy, a metric that can be used to monitor the piglets' growth progress over the lactation cycle.},

  abstract = {Pig vital sign monitoring (e.g., estimating the heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR)) is essential to understand the stress level of the sow and detect the onset of parturition. It helps to maximize peri-natal survival and improve animal well-being in swine production. The existing approach mainly relies on manual measurement, which is labor-intensive and only provides a few points of information. Other sensing modalities such as wearables and cameras are developed to enable more continuous measurement, but are still limited due to animal discomfort, data transfer, and storage challenges. In this paper, we introduce PigV2, the first system to monitor pig heart rate and respiratory rate through ground vibrations. Our approach leverages the insight that both heartbeat and respiration generate ground vibrations when the sow is lying on the floor. We infer vital information by sensing and analyzing these vibrations. The main challenge in developing PigV2 is the overlap of vital- and non-vital-related information in the vibration signals, including pig movements, pig postures, pig-to-sensor distances, and so on. To address this issue, we first characterize their effects, extract their current status, and then reduce their impact by adaptively interpolating vital rates over multiple sensors. PigV2 is evaluated through a real-world deployment with 30 pigs. It has 3.4\% and 8.3\% average errors in monitoring the HR and RR of the sows, respectively.},

  abstract = {Monitoring cardiovascular risk factors requires a method for con-tinuous heart rate monitoring. However, this typically relies on a wearable device which must be issued to, then charged and worn by the user. Ambient sensors can address these challenges, but have only been usable in scenarios where the body is in proximity or contact with these sensors, such as on a bed. In this paper, we present SeatBeats, a system that can monitor heart rate using ambient vibrations in the surface a user sits on. The system relies on the surface's response to heart beat-induced vibrations and utilizes autocorrelation to capture and extract the repeated pattern beats. Our experiments in a real office environment show up to 96\% accuracy relative to a smartwatch heart rate sensor.},

  abstract = {Object classification is a vital technology that is widely used to track and identify misplaced and out-of-stock items in shopping centers. While there have been a number of studies utilizing various sensing modalities such as computer vision, RFID, and vibration sensors, these methods are limited in their use due to privacy concerns, scalability, and the inability to identify stationary objects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel active vibration-sensing approach for object classification by utilizing music as an excitation source. Different objects can induce different deformations of the surface and further change the surface structural response. Therefore, we leverage vibrations from music on a store shelf and measure the structural responses on the surface when different objects are placed. Our evaluation of a store shelf demonstrates that distinct object characteristics lead to unique vibration responses, enabling accurate classification of 98.6\% accuracy in distinguishing five common store objects. This study provides a promising avenue for a reliable, privacy-preserving, and scalable object classification system in various settings beyond shopping centers.},
