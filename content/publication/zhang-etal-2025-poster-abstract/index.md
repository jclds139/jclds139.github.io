abstract: Weight difference estimation is crucial in various applications, particularly for identifying items being picked up and put back when people interact with the shelf while shopping in autonomous stores, ensuring precise cost estimation. However, the conventional approach of estimating weight changes requires specialized weight-sensing shelves, which are densely deployed weight scales, incurring intensive sensor consumption and maintenance costs. Prior works explored the vibration-based weight sensing method, but they are limited to the object that can generate vibration through motion. This work demonstrates a system leveraging active vibration sensing for weight difference estimation on shelves at different locations. The main intuition of the system is that the weight placed on the shelf influences the dynamic vibration response of the shelf, thus altering the shelf vibration patterns. Our system achieves a mean absolute error 9.23 grams and mean absolute percentage error 7.9% on the real-store shelf layout.
