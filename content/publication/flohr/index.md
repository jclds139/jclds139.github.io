abstract:
    Heart rate is one of the most critical metrics for human health. Most common
    methods for measuring human heart rate involve body contact, whether from wearable
    devices or manual measurement. However, such devices can cause discomfort to some
    patients. Past work for non-contact or remote heart rate measurement (e.g., camera
    or radio) is often limited by line-of-sight requirements that are not always possible
    in the real-world environment.This paper presents FloHR, an indirect heart rate
    monitoring system for human beings using heartbeat-induced floor vibrations. The
    key insight is that the human body generates a small wave of pressure and sound
    with each heartbeat. These are propagated as vibration through the structures the
    person is in contact with (e.g., a chair) and through the floor. FloHR then detects
    and interprets these small floor vibrations. We developed a highly sensitive vibration
    sensing system and heartbeat pattern modelling to identify these tiny vibrations
    among other body motions and ambient noise.We evaluated FloHR in a real home environment,
    demonstrating an average heart rate error similar to medical device standards on
    the floor near the subjects' chair, and on the order of 10 beats per minute (bpm)
    on the floor 2 meters away from the subject.
